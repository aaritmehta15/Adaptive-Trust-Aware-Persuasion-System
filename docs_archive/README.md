# Archived Documentation

This folder contains the original documentation files that have been consolidated into the new 3-file structure.

## New Documentation Structure

The documentation has been reorganized for clarity and to eliminate redundancy:

- **[../README.md](../README.md)** - Main entry point with overview and quick start
- **[../ARCHITECTURE.md](../ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Technical reference with code locations and calculations
- **[../RESEARCH.md](../RESEARCH.md)** - Academic context and theoretical foundation

## Archived Files

The following files have been merged into the new structure:

| Old File | Merged Into | Content |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `QUICKSTART.md` | README.md | Quick start guide |
| `README_WEB.md` | README.md | Web UI documentation |
| `SYSTEM_EXPLANATION.md` | README.md & RESEARCH.md | System overview |
| `CODE_LOCATIONS.md` | ARCHITECTURE.md | Code reference with line numbers |
| `TRUST_AND_BELIEF_CALCULATIONS.md` | ARCHITECTURE.md | Calculation formulas |
| `TRUST_RECOVERY_FLOW.md` | ARCHITECTURE.md | Recovery mode flow |
| `C1_VS_C3_COMPARISON.md` | RESEARCH.md | Mode comparison |
| `COMPREHENSIVE_SYSTEM_ANALYSIS.md` | RESEARCH.md | System analysis |

## Why the Change?

**Before:** 9 documentation files (~93KB) with 60-70% redundancy  
**After:** 3 documentation files (~35KB) with zero redundancy

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Clear purpose for each file
- ✅ No duplicate information
- ✅ Easy navigation (3 files instead of 9)
- ✅ Better maintainability
- ✅ 62% size reduction

## Need the Old Files?

All original files are preserved here for reference. However, the new consolidated documentation is more comprehensive and up-to-date.
